Adam's custom emacs config I liked doom, but it's just too much
overhead. I mean, the kitchen sink was included It also has so many
packages that I don't know what they all do. For me, it's better to
just build a config from scratch, learn a bit about elisp, and the
emacs environment along the way.

I also feel like the all-in-one solutions like doom, astrovim, and the
like go against the spirit of using extensible editors. They're
extensibile for YOU, when YOU'RE ready, or find it necessary to make
customizations. Another problem I had with the ready-made solutions
is, how do I know where the underlying tool stops and the
customization begins?

It's kinda like REACT for front-end development. There's a tool to do
the job, Javascript, but people have piled cruft on top of it to make
building a website "easier". The problem is, now devs have to learn
the language and the framework(s).
